# Scope of learning

**Pre-requirement:** IF ELSE, WHILE LOOP

**Goal:** To give a foundation understanding of Pygame

**Duration:** Minimum 12 Lessons (1.5 hour per lesson)

# Learning guidelines

This learning guide offers ample reference material and readily available pygame code to facilitate your learning. We focus on building your understanding by explaining concepts and guiding you step-by-step in creating a basic pygame. We encourage a comprehensive approach to learning rather than simply striving for the final product.

# Style of learning

We utilize a combination of mini-projects and projects to enable students to delve into and grasp the concepts effectively. Rather than solely concentrating on the final code outcome, we encourage students to contemplate how they can enhance it further. The codes given serve as a reference, but we also welcome exploring alternative solutions proposed by the students.
