# Lesson Template

## Objective

This section should describe the learning goals or objectives of the template. It should clearly state what you want to achieve with the learning material.

## Concepts

In this section, you should outline the key concepts that the learner will need to understand in order to achieve the learning objectives. This could include definitions, explanations, and examples. You may want to organize this section by topic or sub-topic.

## Review Questions

This section should include a set of questions that test the learner's understanding of the concepts covered in the previous section. These could be multiple choice questions, short answer questions, or any other format that is appropriate for the learning material.

## Mini Project

This section should provide a mini project or exercise that allows the learner to apply the concepts they have learned in a practical way. This could involve writing code, solving a problem, or completing a task. The mini project should be designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the previous sections and to help the learner build confidence in their skills. You may want to provide example code or a step-by-step guide to help the learner complete the mini project successfully.

# Project Template

## Objective

This section should describe the overall goal of the project. It should clearly state what you want to achieve with your Pygame game.

## User Requirements

In this section, you should define the requirements of the game from the user's perspective. This includes things like game mechanics, user interface, and any other features that the user may want in the game.

## Development Guide

This section should provide a detailed plan for developing your Pygame game. This includes things like:

- Setting up your game window
- Creating game objects (sprites, backgrounds, etc.)
- Adding interactivity (keyboard/mouse input, collisions, etc.)
- Implementing game logic (scoring, levels, game over conditions, etc.)
- Testing and debugging your game

## Sample Code

This section should provide some example code to help get you started. You can include snippets of code that demonstrate different aspects of Pygame game development.

## Enhancement

This section should outline any additional features or improvements you would like to add to your game beyond the initial requirements. This could include things like multiplayer functionality, improved graphics, or additional levels. Think of this section as a roadmap for future development.
