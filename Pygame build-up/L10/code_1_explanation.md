Here is a step-by-step guide to create the timer:

1. Import Pygame: Add the following line at the beginning of your script to import Pygame:

```python
import pygame
```

2. Initialize Pygame: Before using Pygame, you need to initialize it by adding the following code:

```python
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 300))
pygame.display.set_caption("Timer")
```

3. Define variables: Define the timer duration and start time:

```python
duration = 10
start_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()
```

4. Create a font: You will use this font to display the timer on the screen:

```python
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
```

5. Main loop: This is the main loop that will run until the timer runs out. Add the following code:

```python
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    elapsed_time = (pygame.time.get_ticks() - start_time) / 1000
    remaining_time = duration - elapsed_time

    text = font.render("Time remaining: " + str(int(remaining_time)), True, (255, 0, 0))
    screen.blit(text, (100, 100))

    pygame.display.update()
```

6. End the timer: After the timer runs out, add the following code to end the timer:

```python
if remaining_time <= 0:
    running = False
```

7. Quit Pygame: Finall,y add the following line to quit Pygame:

```python
pygame.quit()
```

This should create a timer in Pygame that counts down from the specified duration and displays the remaining time in red on the screen. You can adjust the duration, screen
